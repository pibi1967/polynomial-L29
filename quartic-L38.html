# Borghi Polynomial (L = 38)

## A Structural Prime-Generating Monic Quartic Polynomial

Documented by Paolo Borghi — Verified computationally (2026)

## The polynomial

f(n) = n⁴ − 74n³ + 1525n² − 5772n + 10159

This monic quartic integer polynomial produces a run of 38 consecutive prime values when evaluated at consecutive integers starting at `n = 0`. As usual in this context, primality is tested on the absolute value `|f(n)|`.

Run length: L = 38

### Category: monic quartic prime-generating polynomial

The polynomial

f(n) = n⁴ − 74n³ + 1525n² − 5772n + 10159

is a monic quartic polynomial, since the leading coefficient (the coefficient of n⁴) is equal to 1. This places it within the class of monic quartic prime-generating polynomials, a mathematically significant and more restrictive family than generic quartic polynomials.

In this stricter category, achieving a long consecutive prime run is notably difficult. The polynomial above attains a run length of:

L = 38

establishing an exceptionally long documented prime-generating run for a monic quartic polynomial.

## From L = 35 to L = 38 via translation

### The starting polynomial (L = 35)

The genealogy starts from the quartic

g(n) = n⁴ − 62n³ + 913n² + 1488n + 4651

which generates L = 35 consecutive primes starting at `n = 0`. Explicitly, `|g(n)|` is prime for `n = 0, 1, …, 34`, and the first composite value occurs at `n = 35`:

g(35) = 17531 = 47 × 373.

### The n → n − 1 translation method

Given a polynomial `P(n)` with a long prime run, one can construct a translated polynomial

`Q(n) = P(n − 1).`

If the newly introduced value `P(−1)` is also prime, then the prime run of `Q(n)` starting at `n = 0` is extended by one:

  * `P(n)` is prime for `n = 0, …, L − 1`,
  * `P(L)` is composite,
  * `P(−1)` is prime,

which implies that `Q(n) = P(n − 1)` is prime for `n = 0, …, L`, with the first composite at `n = L + 1`. Iterating this translation constructs a genealogical tree of quartic polynomials, each step corresponding to a shift by `n → n − 1`.

### Structural nature of the record

Applying this method repeatedly to the starting polynomial with `L = 35` yields the structural record

f(n) = n⁴ − 74n³ + 1525n² − 5772n + 10159

with run length L = 38. The process cannot be extended further within this genealogy, as the next value on the negative side is composite:

f(−1) = 17531 = 47 × 373,

preventing another successful translation step that would increase L.

Moreover, every polynomial in this genealogy shares the same first composite value at the breaking point of its prime run:

f_L(L) = 17531 = 47 × 373

for all L in {35, 36, 37, 38}. This is why this family is naturally described as a *structural* record.

## The genealogical tree (L = 38 → L = 35)

Starting from the structural record with L = 38, we obtain a small genealogical family of monic quartic polynomials by iterated translations. Each polynomial `f_{L}(n)` has the form

`f_{L}(n) = n⁴ + a n³ + b n² + c n + d`

and generates exactly L consecutive primes for `n = 0, …, L − 1`. For every entry in this family, the first composite appears at `n = L` and takes the same value:

f_{L}(L) = 17531 = 47 × 373.

The known top part of the genealogical table is:

L  Quartic polynomial f_{L}(n)  
38  n⁴ − 74n³ + 1525n² − 5772n + 10159  
37  n⁴ − 70n³ + 1309n² − 2940n + 5839  
36  n⁴ − 66n³ + 1105n² − 528n + 4139  
35  n⁴ − 62n³ + 913n² + 1488n + 4651  

*(coefficients checked computationally; all entries share f_{L}(L) = 17531 = 47 × 373)*

## Computational verification (sketch)

The structural record and all polynomials in the genealogical family (L = 35, 36, 37, 38) were verified by exhaustive evaluation and deterministic primality checks on 64-bit integers.

For the record polynomial

f(n) = n⁴ − 74n³ + 1525n² − 5772n + 10159

we have:

  * `|f(n)|` is prime for `n = 0, 1, …, 37`,
  * the first composite appears at `n = 38`,
  * `f(38) = 17531 = 47 × 373`.
